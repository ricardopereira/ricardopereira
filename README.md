### Hello there! üëã

I'm a full-time remote citizen, working extensively with mobile platforms, native frameworks and embracing new technologies. I worked on several open source libraries and mobile apps like [Circuit](https://ridecircuit.com), [Optimize](https://www.heroic.us/optimize), [Ably.io](https://ably.io), [Mealcard](https://mealcard.whitesmith.co) and [Money](https://ricardopereira.eu/money/) (the one I work on my spare time).

Everyone should invest in their financial literacy and [**Money**](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/money-the-fastest-expense-tracker/id1076339783?l=en) is one of the tools you can use to arise a better understanding of your daily spending... the key of personal finance.

I also dedicate my spare time to patients with Primary Immunodeficiency. I'm the current president of [APDIP.pt](https://apdip.pt). I have a PID called Agammaglobulinemia/Bruton.
