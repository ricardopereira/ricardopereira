### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm from Lisbon (Portugal), full-time remote citizen, working extensively with mobile platforms, native frameworks and embracing new technologies like ML. I work on several open source libraries and mobile apps like [Optimize.me](https://optimize.me), [Ably.io](https://ably.io), [Mealcard](https://mealcard.whitesmith.co) and [Money](https://twitter.com/MoneyTrackerApp) (the one I work on my spare time).

Everyone should invest on their financial literacy and [**Money**](https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/money-the-fastest-expense-tracker/id1076339783?l=en) is one of the tools you should use to arise a better understanding of your daily spending... the key of personal finance.

I also dedicate my spare time to patients with Primary Immunodeficiency. I'm the current president and CEO of [APDIP.pt](https://apdip.pt). I have a PID called Agammaglobulinemia/Bruton.
